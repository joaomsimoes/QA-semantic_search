 Buy bitcoin and holding your bitcoin position! The only way to have peace of mind with your bitcoin exposure is to actually own and hold bitcoin
 Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges
 Maybe even start a Bitcoin enterprise where you pay in Bitcoin

Hello bitcoin community
 Bitcoin fuels everything
BTC IS LOVE, BTC IS LIFE, BTC IS THE FUTURE
8 BTC in his BTC wallet
 So pairs like BTC/ETH, BTC/LTC, etc
 we run with btc, and btc will run again
\#BTC 4 hr TF: #BTC has retraced down to 38
004139962 Bitcoin (BTC)
More than 1 btc? I had no issue moving BTC off recently
interesting thread on the theory that Litecoin is used by BTC whales to facilitate BTC buys using the BTC/LTC pair
5 APY while directing ETH to pay BTC and BTC to pay ETH
Man owning a ton of BTC predicts BTC will be huge one day
 Mined 305 new Bitcoin (BTC) during September 2021; approximately 10 BTC mined daily
Miners are priced in BTC so pricing is somewhat correlated to BTC price
**BTC TOKENIZED ON ETHEREUM** In May, the amount of BTC on Ethereum (represented by tokenized BTC such as WBTC) surpassed the amount of BTC on the Lightning Network, Bitcoin‚Äôs layer 2 scaling network

im mining ETH, I keep 1 ETH per day in my wallet, waiting for the appreciation of ETH 2
 You now have 40 ETH and your friend has 15 ETH
 Like when eth split to eth classic, it can still happen
 BULLISH ON ETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Eth isn‚Äôt decentralized tho
Eth or Tezos probably, I think Tezos has the second biggest DeFi ecosystem behind Eth
 ETH EIP 1559 was delayed til tomorrow, not because the people at ETH are incompetent
 ETH looks great and from a technical standpoint ETH is more bullish than even BTC
 Now this is the situation in the current POW consensus (ETH), but when ETH 2
Article below covers the upgrade process better, it was posted on eth sub Eth 2
ETH is absolutely killing it
Eth looks toppy as hell
There's already PAXG on eth
 I hold LTC, BTC, ETH
 BTC, ETH, XRM and Tether
I always use USDC, never Tether
Sooooo also bullish on Tether? Hahha
 Tether is not, hence keep away
hey aren‚Äôt those the tether guys
 Newton is also getting of tether
 SAFEMOON, ATOM, MATIC, TETHER, 1INCH, BUNNY
 Tether is authorized, moved to Bitfinex, and then slowly distributed to other Tether-based exchanges, mainly Poloniex and Bittrex
 wait what? Bitfinex IS tether? oh my
6 Additionally, we find that the cross-exchange Bitcoin flows on Bitcoin blockchain closely matches the Tether flows on Tether blockchain
 The graph shows that almost no Tether returns to the Tether issuer to be redeemed, and the major exchange where Tether can be exchanged for USD, Kraken, accounts for only a small proportion of transactions
 USDC, DAI, and Tether are on Ethereum's chain
Owned by the same creators of Tether https://youtu
I've been wary of Tether for a long time
Tether may collapse after governments issue CBDCs; not before that
Atleast these clowns have nothing to do with USDT/Tether
 Is Bitcoin Really un-tethered? some snippets from the paper: **flow of tether between exchanges, the main players:** Figure 1 plots the aggregate flow of Tether among major market participants on the Tether blockchain from its conception in October 6, 2014 until March 31, 2018
I'm so glad to see that Tether was NOT in this list!
 **a large player is likely responsiblle for a lot of this:** we find that one large player is associated with more than half of the exchange of Tether for Bitcoin at Bitfinex, suggesting that the distribution of Tether into the market is from a large player and not many different investors bringing cash to Bitfinex to purchase Tether **people who worked on the inside even admit tether isnt backed 1:1** in response to legal motions, on April 30, 2019, Bitfinex‚Äôs former General Counsel admitted that Tether does not have cash reserves equal to 100% of the outstanding Tethers
 If authorities should shut down Tether, a lot of money will flow out of crypto
 In the pilot version of spot trading, the exchange now supports BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT and EOS/USDT trading pairs while more to "follow shortly

 So for USDT for example
 But stay away from USDT
xx to buy $100usdc/usdt Edit
 It was a good amount of USDT
 Deposit at least $25,000 of USDT or USDC

 Simply hold $USDTmine earn passive income in USDT

 Usdc and usdt come out $4 cheaper on ndax
It's my favourite stable coin! Miles ahead of usdt
Atleast these clowns have nothing to do with USDT/Tether
 Stablecoins like $USDT, $EURST, and $USDC will entirely replace fiat currency
 Use USDC only as USDT pretty much prints money as well
 So option 1 but you only provide VET and no usdt

 If you want to be on Cardano, build and release your token on Cardano
 Cardano is easy to build on and this gives Cardano a nice case for competing
 It‚Äôll be interesting to see a real Cardano native stablecoin active on a Cardano DEX

It‚Äôs rigged shit‚Ä¶ if they want ADA they will add ADA‚Ä¶
5 Ada is collateral and the other 2 Ada is returned
 The staking ada will be added to your Total ada balance
According to Coin Metrics only 10% of ADA holders possess 94% of ADA
 ADA is getting redristributed

 Now when I try to send back the ADA yoroi asks 1 ADA tx fees
holyyyyyy, ada is popping off
io the ADA is showing
Check out ADA Handle project
 In summary, ADA is NGMI
Canadian noob ADA holder here
 solutions for the ADA token
 Downloaded the entire ADA blockchain
Maladex, staking pools give either MAL tokens ADA or 0 ADA and all MAL in return
Sigma usd has in my mind the best solution for a stable coin
 Btw in USD terms you would in profit of 600+ I used historical btc data from coin metrics
 They accepted crypto assets include bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), DAI, and USD coin (USDC)
 It is then converted to USD, where 50% is placed in market orders, as split in the coin breakdown above
I think the definition of a "stable coin" as being stable against a USD "peg" is not an ideal definition
 LITERALLY! ScroogeCoin cryptocurrency is a rewards coin that gives its holders 8% $BUSD reflections, a Crypto Pegged one-to-one with the USD
 So they exchange the amount for USD and send you USD
 Ltc bear cycle low: 20 usd, current cycle high 412 usd
 They‚Äôll probably come up with a eUSD coin, where you can trade 1-1 at the bank with usd, thus letting KYC/AML regulations work
The market follows USD
2k USD just isn't reasonable when the going rate is upward of 10k USD
 EDIT: Clarifying that the asset I borrowed was a USD stablecoin, not direct USD
Which exchange is the best to cash out this large amount from Crypto USD USD account in Canadian bank account? I don't want it in CAD since USD is better, CAD will deteriorate against the USD, would like to cashout to USD in a canadian bank account
Which exchange allows me to withdraw usd into my usd account at my canadian bank??
>I don't want it in CAD since USD is better, CAD will deteriorate against the USD LOL
 Swapping it to a stable coin or USD and keeping it on the exchange is probably the easiest and most cost efficient way of doing what you want to do
B but not the USD one
html **USD vs DCEP vs BTC!**
 Let's say you give a 5 USD note to a company then that company gives you 5 crypto $USD
I believe I saw USD on Net
 Demand is increasing for USDC
15% APY for USDC coin
USDC, and DAI for the win
I always use USDC, never Tether
 BTC and usdc rate is 6
08 USDC (yup, only 8 cents)
5% on USDC is pretty great
Do some research on USDC staking
I thought usdc was managed by circle?
 Deposit at least 75 USDC or 0
USDC, BUSD and UST are solid options
com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos Some good discussion about adding usdc in this link
 The minimum amount to trade is 50 USDC
 Deposit at least $25,000 of USDT or USDC
 Deposit at least $50 of USDT or USDC
Ledn offers interest rates of 9% on USDC
 USDC, DAI, and Tether are on Ethereum's chain
USDC on Polygon n Solana because its cheap
 Deposit at least $200 of USDT or USDC
 When we hit what looks like the top of the run, I'll focus the velocity to USDC to have something to buy the dip with! You can also get USDC in USDC, which itself grows at 12

 I'm hoping to build on Solana but happy to use Ethereum
There seems to be a lot of hype behind Solana lately

 I just invested more into hnt, polygon and sol
how does SOL compare to that? Thanks for any insight
 $SOL rewards will be distributed manually to the eligible Holders
 That's why i ape in stable coins SOL BMI and BTC
Only things I'm holding long-term are BTC, ETH, SOL, MATIC
 SOL for example outperformed Doge 4x even tho its a shitcoin
 This is for transferring my SOL from procoinbase to my phantom wallet
 I think most of us hoped VET would be something like SOL
 I don't know much about DOT SOL use a Ledger for connecting to dApps
 Now I will keep SOL I will not trade for a stable coin or fiat
questions just as above, I need some SOL, but Newton won't let me withdraw it
 I didn't end up buying SOL mainly because the price has risen so much lately

 TERRA LUNA is amazing
 USTerra is on the Terra chain
 One example is Anchor protocol on Terra Luna
 The Cardano Summit 2021 Terra Virtua NFTs have arrived
 I'd just spend the money developing on the Terra ecosystem
Look at the terra network (LUNA) and UST stable coin
 Terra is a blockchain protocol for creating stablecoins pegged to various currencies
 Looking to dip my toes into Fantom, Polygon, and Terra ecosystems for instance
 Terra Virtua is saying we‚Äôll have our Cardano Summit 2021 NFTs by November 10th
I love the terra blockchain myself and have dabbled some with coding in its api
 People always look at the terra and solana and think why is vet not doing anything
tldr; LUNA, the native token of the Terra network, hit a new all-time high of $84
 Projects like White Whale Terra, MetaHero, Women Empowerment Token, Binamon and many are using NFTs to grow their ecosystem
All actual alternatives (Solana, Avalanche, Terra, Fantom) really only got started in the past 6 months, on 1st of January 2021 Ethereum's dominance in DeFi was like 99%
Can someone ELI5 for me how LUNA and UST are connected? Its written in the article but I still don't understand it: >Terra is a blockchain protocol for creating algorithmic stablecoins pegged to various fiat currencies, alongside decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure
 Luna in TerraStation / Anchor
 TERRA LUNA is amazing
LUNA don't care about if market is red or green, maybe LUNA is colorblind
Luna is a great project
 Congrats to the Luna holders
LUNA went right to the moon
The same thing happened with Luna
 One example is Anchor protocol on Terra Luna
Mix your bag man, dot,sol,VeChain, Luna‚Ä¶
I¬¥m glad i¬¥ve some Luna in my portfolio
 It's going to be a glorious time for LUNA holders
There is no other coin on the market like LUNA
Look at the terra network (LUNA) and UST stable coin
 And that coins such as SHIB, DOGE, ETC, MATIC, LUNA et al
 LUNA is now the industry‚Äôs ninth-largest cryptocurrency, having surpassed both Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT)
tldr; LUNA, the native token of the Terra network, hit a new all-time high of $84
 #cosmonaut,juggernaut,osmonaut Lunatics are a different breed of crazy, but I own a healthy amount of Luna
The last 30 day charts of the first 30 coin are showing heavy bleeding except Luna and Matic
 You can invest in solid crypto projects like ETH, BNB, MATIC, OCEAN, FET, LINK, SOL, LUNA, AVAX, etc
 It will let you provide Ethereum or Luna as collateral, and in return you can borrow UST stable coin
 >POLKADOT The problem with Polkadot is that they are more or less a collection of independent blockchains
 Polkadot/Kusama, the hub and parachains approach
 * Polkadot has announced a launch of 5 parachains
Fancied Polkadot and Kusama which are really beautifull projects
0, and Polkadot, and checks in on their status
 Alongside Polkadot substrate and parachains, Polkadot bridge seems to be another cutting-edge tech trying to connect all main chains and build an integrated ecosystem
Cosmos/Polkadot/Kusama the cr√®me de la cr√®me of interoperability
 I have bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, polkadot and Theta left in my wallet
Check Substrate Polkadot created Substrate as a framework (on Rust) to create blockchains
 polkadot has an onboarding mechanism for people who want to migrate from ATOM
 I am really bullish for Polkadot (DOT) also after the recent parachain launches
 Why do keep smart contract functionality on eth at all? This sounds pretty much like Polkadot, which was build for this from the get go, so this concept sounds like a worse Polkadot
g ethereum, i believe in the case of polkadot each parachain is a shard
Substrate is a framework for building blockchains made by the parity people (making polkadot)
 The only bridges available are to Ethereum, Monero, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Binance Smart Chain
 Blockchains interacting with Polkadot are using it, but there are also tons of other blockchains using it even if not interacting with Polkadot now, since it's probably the most modulated/worked blockchain-specific framework right now
 They have partnered up with many projects such as ***Aave, Sushi, Polkadot, ATROMG8, Intexcoin, and DDR***
 im not saying that polkadot is better, its just there hence the similarities with the projects
 LUNA is now the industry‚Äôs ninth-largest cryptocurrency, having surpassed both Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT)

It will be most likely Avalanche with its subnets
 &#x200B; It's a fork of Olympus DAO on Avalanche
 Solana, avalanche we offer fast transactions with cheap gas rates
 Top picks for the individual - Ethereum Solana BSC Cardano Harmony Avalanche
 Fork choice algorithms are for example: Nakamoto consensus (Bitcoin, Ethereum 1) Casper FFG, Friendly Finality Gadget (Ethereum 2) Casper CBC, Correct-by-Construction (from Vlad Zamfir) Avalanche (Avalanche) Lachesis (Fantom)
 PEPE is a decentralised reserve meme currency protocol built on the Avalanche network
 ($TIME for example) I know I can export funds to Avalanche C-Chain no problem
 A few examples of individual ones I've found very educational: Algorand Avalanche Cardano Ethereum 2
 It also seems that Avalanche does not even support cross-subnet transactions at all, right now
 LUNA is now the industry‚Äôs ninth-largest cryptocurrency, having surpassed both Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT)
 Pepe DAO is the decentralized meme reserve currency protocol available on the Avalanche Network based on the PEPE token
A new token on Avalanche with value that cannot be estimated Potential for crazy gains if you get in at launch 
I'm pretty new to the crypto space, and have mainly been experimenting on the Avalanche chain, due to the low fees and active ecosystem
 I'm aware of some of the more well known ones like Avalanche and Hashgraph, but am curious what others I may not yet be aware of
All actual alternatives (Solana, Avalanche, Terra, Fantom) really only got started in the past 6 months, on 1st of January 2021 Ethereum's dominance in DeFi was like 99%
 The project will also expand to the Ethereum, Avalanche, and Harmony Blockchain in order to have a stable growth in the future and also to gather lots of Investors
 While we've seen nation-states and corporations alike adopt Bitcoin, we‚Äôve too witnessed the explosion of exchanges (DEXs and CEXs) and other layer one protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche

PepeDAO is an OHM fork on the AVAX network
 MIRA will also expand into other Blockchains like ETH, AVAX, and ONE
Did u check on avax network on coinbase wallet Usually its defaulted in eth network so u might need to switch to avax network in ur settings to see if its there
 AVAX is nice and I absolutely love the work but I‚Äôm exclusive to Cosmos
I know that SOL and AVAX you can purchase them on coinbase and send them directly to a SOLANA or AVAX wallet, but other tokens like BNB (BEP20) and MATIC you have to use an actual bridge
 LUNA is now the industry‚Äôs ninth-largest cryptocurrency, having surpassed both Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT)
 Though I believe some altcoins like MATIC, ONE, AVAX, ALGO, VET can give good gains also
 Way less than anywhere else I use including avax!!! Bch is the black horse in my opinion
 They support withdrawals to avax c chain (rather than x chain like most exchanges) so that's nice
 You can invest in solid crypto projects like ETH, BNB, MATIC, OCEAN, FET, LINK, SOL, LUNA, AVAX, etc
üíé Next 100x Project!üíØ Angele Printer TIme on Avax Do you want to get crazy rewards will enjoying life
 To move it to address provided by metamask, which is BTW same as the address I use on avax network
 Furthermore, arbitrary DAGs have known performance problems under adoption, they initially have many more execution channels, because transactions are largely unrelated, but as adoption picks up and massive dpps appear on the platform the overall performance decreases because transactions become increasingly related >AVAX Avax mainnet is unsharded
 For example say you have your money stored in avax in the trust wallet and avax goes down 5% is there any way to sell or swap the avax automatically for a stable coin such as usdt or mim? The reasons are obvious, that you can't be observing the prices 24 hours a day and I thought I could swap into a stable coun after say a certain % decrease to minimise any loses
, MIM, AVAX, LP Tokens etc etc) in the Pepe DAO treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below
 My metamask had ethereum network and avax network so I simply added smart bitcoin cash network using information provided by benswap
 I'm not just shilling VET here I think a few projects achieve this: ETH, XMR, ONE, ALGO, LUNA, AVAX, SOL, etc
 The exchanges I currently can use don't support the coins I wanted to buy (ALGO, MATIC, LUNA, AVAX, ATOM, GALA, and ONE)
 And I found out that I can export funds to Ethereum too (found this out when I tried to send $SPELL to my avax wallet, and found it in my ETH network instead) I want to know what chains I can export funds to outside of AVAX and ETH networks
 4 of the 5 assets made it over, but 1 (AVAX) seems to have disappeared, despite identical steps being followed for all transfers
 Buy USDC (Polygon) on PayTrie (Polygon version for least fees) 2
 Was learning about polygon
 #polygon #crypto #cryptocurrency #valuesfinance
 #polygon #crypto #matic #spyrit
 Polygon outperformed it 4x too
 Then you can transfer your ETH on Polygon for dirt cheap anywhere that supports ETH on polygon
 #polygon #crypto #matic #spyrit https://spyritcoin
 LRC is ETH adjacent like Polygon
\#polygon #crypto #cryptocurrency #valuesfinance https://values
 However, I am only using Polygon / Crypto
 Projects like Polygon are not slacking off
 Polygon BSC bridge are using their technology
 It's on the polygon blockchain: https://www

 Decided to go in on Matic

Good to see MATIC and CRO in top 10
Matic is down 16 percent and we are 7
Got some good assets tbh in MATIC ad Eth
 These 2 are kind of my faves, especially MATIC
The only thing I'd sell on good conscience Matic
 On April 26, 2019 , Matic offered a seed investment round in which 209 million MATIC tokens were sold for a value of 161 thousand dollars 
L2 projects like LRC and MATIC are related to Ethereum?
So it‚Äôs similar to the side chain like Polygon (Matic)?

This isn't Shib, this isn't Doge
SHIB isn't what you think it is
57 of Shib for the network fee
Nothing surprising but Shib taking 7th is quiet astounding
 Or is this a glitch or known error for SHIB price history?
 And that coins such as SHIB, DOGE, ETC, MATIC, LUNA et al
I transferred Shib from Coinbase to my Coinbase wallet and it took $6
 SHIB runs on ETH blockchain so wallet app will need fees in ETH
 To trade Shib for Ethereum it's going to be anywhere from $200 to $400
 Team has a record in the space, they were the first to market SHIB
What will be the cheapest way to move my Shib from Binance to crypto
So I‚Äôm new to all the token craze and I bought the shib and sold
maybe I should cut my losses and just invest more into SHIB, like wtf VET
